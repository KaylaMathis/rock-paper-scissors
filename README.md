# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game but with a fun little twist. The same game principles of rock, paper, scissors, but you use troll, mermaid or fairy. 
Rock is comparable to Troll. 
Paper is comparable to Mermaid.
Scissors is comparable to Fairy.
The idea was to make the whole project a little whimsical. You are playing troll, mermaid, or fairy against the computer. First player to five wins the game. There is score board, tally for each player, and what each other chose for that round.

### Functional Tasks and Goals
Main goals were getting the Javascript to function as expected for this game. Getting the input from the user and a random input from the computer. After getting the values from each player, comparing the values to see who won that round and updating the score board, what each other chose and score tally.
HTML and CSS were also used to get the page displayed and into position.
